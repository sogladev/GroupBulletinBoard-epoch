## Description
GroupBulletinBoard (GBB) provides an overview of the endless requests in the 
chat channels. It detects all requests to the instances, sorts them and presents 
them clearly way. Numerous filtering options reduce the gigantic number to 
exactly the dungeons that interest you. And if that's not enough, GBB will let 
you know about any new request via a sound or chat notification.

Currently, English, German, Russian and Chinese dungeons are recognized 
natively. But it is easily possible to adapt GBB to any language.

To open the settings, use slash command: **`/gbb`** or click the minimap icon.
